Net::Rwhois version 0.09

This is the perl5 Net::Rwhois distribution.  It requires perl5.003,
IO::Socket and IO::Handle.

It is intended to provide a RWhois client API for RWhois versions 1.0
and 1.5.

Major Changes:

* Referral chasing has been added.
* Minimal Whois query support has been added.
* A sample command-line client has been provided.

To install the library, run these commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

An example script that uses some of the API is in t/perl_rwhois.pl.
THIS IS NOT A CLIENT. It is just a static example of how to use the
classes.

An example CGI script is in bin/prwhois.cgi.  This is only roughly
sketched out, but it basically works.

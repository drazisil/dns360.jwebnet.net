2000-10-09  David Blacka  <davidb@research.netsol.com>

        * Release version 0.08.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/QueryResult.pm (read_results): Handle unexpected
	socket closures.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Query.pm (_execute_query_set_limit): handle an
	undefined 'limit' setting.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Connection.pm (read_line): Handle unexpected
	socket closures.
	(is_open): Detect unexpected socket closures.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois.pm (execute_query): Fail quickly when the socket
	closes unexpectedly on us.
	(recursive_execute_query): same.

	* bin/prwhois.cgi: Largely refactored.  Now can do whois queries
	as well.

2000-07-17  David Blacka  <davidb@netsol.com>

	* bin/prwhois.cgi: do not use "my" when creating global
	variables.  This does not work under mod_perl.
	(query_rwhois): do not remove the "host" and "port" parameters
	from the query string in the ID refererence URL.
	(simple_format_referrals): use $script_name for the referral URL.
	(simple_format_errors): strip perl's line number reporting from
	the error display; skip empty error messages.
	(simple_format_heading): add the query and query URL to the
	response header.
	(main_cgi): reset the url if the CGI is overriding it; trap all
	rwhois query errors.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/RwhoisObject.pm (_translate_type_to_text): return
	"TEXT" even when $type is not defined.  This suppresses some perl
	warnings.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Query.pm (_execute_query_set_limit): new.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Connection.pm: use carp() instead of croak() on
	connection errors

2000-03-24  David Blacka  <davidb@netsol.com>
	* Net-Rwhois: released version 0.06

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/WhoisResult.pm: added.  This class reads the
 	WHOIS result.  It does not attempt to parse the whois result.  It
 	does make a limited attempt to separate the legal langaguage that
 	preceded some WHOIS responses from the actual response.  It cannot
 	tell the difference between multiple record and single record
 	responses.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/WhoisQuery.pm: added.  This class submits a query 
	to a WHOIS server.  It does some trivial query re-writing based on 
	whether or not it thinks the whois server will understand they
	object-class keyword.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/ResultSet.pm: added.  This class encaps both the
	records and referrals resulting from a query.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/ReferralSet.pm: added.  This class handles groups 
	of equivalent referrals.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Referral.pm: Add a member variable for
	'protocol', so this class can handle whois referrals (and possibly 
	others).

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Connection.pm: add a debug mode.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois.pm: Added referral chasing master query function.

	* bin/regyrwhois.cgi: added.  Sample CGI script for the prototype
	rwhois registry referral server.  Primarily, a rwhois CGI that
	expects to just get (and follow) whois referrals.

	* bin/prwhois.pl: added.  Command line client that chases referrals.

	* bin/prwhois.cgi: add the 'overrideurl' CGI parameter.  Add logic 
	to allow for deployment without officially installing Net::Rwhois
	(i.e., FindBin stuff)

1998-07-29  David Blacka  <davidb@netsol.com>
        
	* Net-Rwhois: released version 0.04.

	* bin/prwhois.cgi: added sample CGI script. Many people asked for
	this.
	
	* lib/Net/Rwhois/RwhoisObject.pm (set_attribute_type): added.
	(get_attribute_type): added.  Basically, logic was added to help
	track the type info coming back for RWhois 1.5.
	(to_hash): Make return a hash, not a hashref.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/QueryResult.pm (get_rwhois_errors): added this
	routine and the surrounding logic.
	(parse_rwhois_referral): Make actually work.
	(_parse_object_1_5): add logic to track attribute types. 

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Connection.pm (open): do not croak, only carp if
	open fails.  Probably should remove croak altogether from these
	modules.

1998-07-06  David Blacka  <davidb@netsol.com>

	* Net-Rwhois: released version 0.03.
	
	* lib/Net/Rwhois.pm: new version (0.03).

	* t/perl_rwhois.pl: use sane values for the example.

1998-02-18  David Blacka  <davidb@rwhois.net>

	* lib/Net/Rwhois.pm: fix documentation to show correct usage of
		  "execute_query" method.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/RwhoisObject.pm: make
	          set-{class-name,auth_area,id} methods private. Also make
		  those methods always set a real attribute.

Mon Nov 10 13:42:48 1997  David Blacka  <davidb@rwhois.net>

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Connection.pm (configure): added a Referral
		  object constructor argument.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/Referral.pm: added.

Thu Jul 24 21:07:16 1997  David Blacka  <davidb@rwhois.net>

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/QueryResult.pm: removed parse_rwhois_object() and
		  related methods (moved to RwhoisObject.pm).  Replaced
		  references to the method with a RwhoisObject constructor
		  call.

	* lib/Net/Rwhois/RwhoisObject.pm (new): added initialization
		  methods via configure().
		  (configure): added.
		  (parse_rwhois_object): added
		  (_parse_object_1_0): added
		  (_parse_object_1_5): added
